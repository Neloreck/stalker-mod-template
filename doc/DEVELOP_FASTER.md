## üèóÔ∏è Develop faster

To simplify development and test everything faster watch script or separate building steps can be used. <br/>
Also you can utilize your IDE to create RUN options and execute all the scripts with a single click (in WebStorm or VSCode).

### Example: only lua scripts are being updated

- run `npm run watch:scripts`, start watch process to rebuild scripts in realtime

### Example: only UI form changed

- run `npm run build:ui`, rebuild only UI forms

### Example: only LTX config changed

- run `npm run build:configs`, rebuild only UI forms

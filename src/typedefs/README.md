# [XRTS](../) / SRC / TYPEDEFS

This folder contains global Lua definitions or XRay engine typings that are used across the mod. <br/>
By defining Lua types, we can help ensure type safety in our TypeScript codebase.  <br/>
By providing Xray engine typings, we can improve editor intellisense, making it easier to develop and debug the mod.

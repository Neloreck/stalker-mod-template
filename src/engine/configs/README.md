## LTX configurations

- Used to configure game parameters and overwrite existing ones

## LTX vs TS

There is no major differences what to use for configuration files, both sides have pros/cons. <br/>
With `typescript` variant you can generate different variations on build time, check types and share parts. <br/>
With `ini` variant it is less verbose and standard across modding community.
